\title{Simulates confidence interval coverage probability for a paired-samples mean
difference}
\usage{
sim.ci.mean.ps(alpha, n, sd.ratio, cor, dist1, dist2)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{n}{sample size}

\item{sd.ratio}{ratio of population standard deviations}

\item{cor}{population correlation of paired observations}

\item{dist1}{type of distribution at level 1 (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)}

\item{dist2}{type of distribution at level 2 (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
\itemize{
\item 1 = Gaussian (skewness = 0 and excess kurtosis = 0)
\item 2 = platykurtic (skewness = 0 and excess kurtosis = -1.2)
\item 3 = leptokurtic (skewness = 0 and excess kurtsois = 6)
\item 4 = moderate skew (skewness = 1 and excess kurtosis = 1.5)
\item 5 = large skew (skewness = 2 and excess kurtosis = 6)
}}
}
\value{
Returns a 1-row matrix. The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Coverage - probability of confidence interval including population mean
\item Lower Error - probability of lower limit greater than population mean
\item Upper Error - probability of upper limit less than population mean
\item Ave CI Width - average confidence interval width
}
}
\description{
Performs a computer simulation (20,000 Monte Carlo samples) of confidence
interval performance for a mean difference in a paired-samples design. Sample
data within each level of the within-subjects factor group can be generated
from bivariate population distributions with five different marginal
distributions. All distributions are scaled to have standard deviations of
1.0 at level 1. Bivariate random data with specified marginal skewness and
kurtosis are generated using the unonr function in the mnonr package.
