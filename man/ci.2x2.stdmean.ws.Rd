\title{Computes confidence intervals of standardized effects in a 2x2
within-subjects design}
\usage{
ci.2x2.stdmean.ws(alpha, y11, y12, y21, y22)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{y11}{vector of scores at level 1 of A and level 1 of B}

\item{y12}{vector of scores at level 1 of A and level 2 of B}

\item{y21}{vector of scores at level 2 of A and level 1 of B}

\item{y22}{vector of scores at level 2 of A and level 2 of B}
}
\value{
Returns a 7-row matrix (one row per effect). The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - estimated standardized effect
\item adj Estimate - bias adjusted standardized effect estimate
\item SE - standard error
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
Computes confidence intervals for standardized linear contrasts of means
(AB interaction, main effect of A, main effect of B, simple main effects
of A, and simple main effects of B) in a 2x2 within-subjects design.
Equality of population variances is not assumed. An unweighted variance
standardizer is used. A square root unweigthed average variance
standardizer is used.
