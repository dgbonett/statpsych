\title{Computes tests and confidence intervals of effects in a 2x2 betwen-subjects
design for means}
\usage{
ci.2x2.mean.bs(alpha, y11, y12, y21, y22)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{y11}{vector of scores at level 1 of A and level 1 of B}

\item{y12}{vector of scores at level 1 of A and level 2 of B}

\item{y21}{vector of scores at level 2 of A and level 1 of B}

\item{y22}{vector of scores at level 2 of A and level 2 of B}
}
\value{
Returns a 7-row matrix (one row per effect). The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - estimate of effect
\item SE - standard error
\item t - t test statistic
\item df - degrees of freedom
\item p - p-value
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
Computes confidence intervals and p-values for the AB interaction effect,
main effect of A, main efect of B, simple main effects of A, and simple main
effects of B in a 2x2 between-subjects design with a quantitative response
variable. A Satterthwaite adjustment to the degrees of freedom is used and
equality of population variances is not assumed.
