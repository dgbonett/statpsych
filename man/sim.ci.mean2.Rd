\title{Simulates confidence interval coverage probability for a two-group mean
difference}
\usage{
sim.ci.mean2(alpha, n1, n2, sd.ratio, dist1, dist2)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{n1}{sample size in group 1}

\item{n2}{sample size in group 2}

\item{sd.ratio}{ratio of population standard deviations}

\item{dist1}{type of distribution in group 1 (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)}

\item{dist2}{type of distribution in group 2 (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
\itemize{
\item 1 = Gaussian (skewness = 0 and excess kurtosis = 0)
\item 2 = platykurtic (skewness = 0 and excess kurtosis = -1.2)
\item 3 = leptokurtic (skewness = 0 and excess kurtsois = 6)
\item 4 = moderate skew (skewness = 1 and excess kurtosis = 1.5)
\item 5 = large skew (skewness = 2 and excess kurtosis = 6)
}}
}
\value{
Returns a 1-row matrix. The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Coverage - probability of confidence interval including population mean
\item Lower Error - probability of lower limit greater than population mean
\item Upper Error - probability of upper limit less than population mean
\item Ave CI Width - average confidence interval width
}
}
\description{
Performs a computer simulation (20,000 Monte Carlo samples) of separate
variance and pooled variance confidence interval performance for a mean
difference in a two-group design. Sample data within each group can be
generated from five different population distributions. All distributions
are scaled to have a standard deviation of 1.0 in group 1.
