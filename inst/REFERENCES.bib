abstract = {The tetrachoric correlation describes the linear relation between two continuous variables that have each been measured on a dichotomous scale. The treatment of the point estimate, standard error, interval estimate, and sample size requirement for the tetrachoric correlation is cursory and incomplete in modern psychometric and behavioral statistics texts. A new and simple method of accurately approximating the tetrachoric correlation is introduced. The tetrachoric approximation is then used to derive a simple standard error, confidence interval, and sample size planning formula. The new confidence interval is shown to perform far better than the confidence interval computed by SAS. A method to improve the SAS confidence interval is proposed. All of the new results are computationally simple and are ideally suited for textbook and classroom presentations.},

abstract = {A new effect size representing the predictive power of an independent variable from a multiple regression model is presented. The index, denoted as r sp , is the semipartial correlation of the predictor with the outcome of interest. This effect size can be computed when multiple predictor variables are included in the regression model and represents a partial effect size in the correlation family. The derivations presented in this article provide the effect size and its variance. Standard errors and confidence intervals can be computed for individual r sp values. Also, meta-analysis of the semipartial correlations can proceed in a similar fashion to typical meta-analyses, where weighted analyses can be used to explore heterogeneity and to estimate central tendency and variation in the effects. The authors provide an example from a meta-analysis of studies of the relationship of teacher verbal ability to school outcomes.},

Confidence intervals for ratios of population means and medians in independent-samples designs and paired-samples designs are proposed as supplements to the independent-samples t test and paired-samples t test. The performance of the proposed confidence intervals are evaluated in a simulation study. The proposed confidence interval methods are extended to the case of a 2 x m factorial design that includes propensity score stratification and meta-analysis as special cases. R functions that implement the recommended confidence intervals are provided in the Supplemental Material file, available in the online version of this article, and are illustrated with several examples.},
